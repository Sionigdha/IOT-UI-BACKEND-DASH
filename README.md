# IoT Monitoring Dashboard (Mock Machine Setup)

A full-stack IoT monitoring dashboard that simulates machine sensor data and visualizes it in real time using a backend API and a web-based UI.

This project uses a **mock machine** to generate telemetry data, which is ingested into a time-series database and displayed on a live dashboard.
